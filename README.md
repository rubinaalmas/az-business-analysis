- **Business-Level Analysis**  
  Focused on identifying high-performing business categories, location-based patterns, and attributes that attract customers in Arizona.

- **Customer-Level Analysis**  
  Investigated user behavior, sentiment trends, and community influence based on reviews and engagement metrics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Apache Spark & PySpark
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- Spark SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (via Virtual Machine)
